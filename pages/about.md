I am an urban spatial analytics graduate student with a background in anthropology, focused on understanding how people, infrastructure, and policy interact across space. I use spatial data science, analytics, and visualization to study urban systems, accessibility, and inequality.

I am currently a data intern with the City of Philadelphia’s Managing Director’s Office - Health and Human Services, and I also work on applied research and consulting projects through Wharton Impact and Sustability Consulting, as well as a collaboration practicum project with Distributed AI Research Institute.

I enjoy learning about other people’s projects and would love to talk with you about your work, especially if you use geospatial data. Let’s chat!


**Interests**: urban data, spatial equity, public-sector analysis, geospatial visualization
