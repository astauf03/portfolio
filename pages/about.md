# Alexandra Stauffer's Portfolio

I am a geospatial analytics graduate student with a background in anthropology, focused on understanding how people, infrastructure, and policy interact across space. My work combines spatial data science, analytics, and visualization to examine urban systems, accessibility, and inequality.

Currently I am a data intern at the City of Philadelphia - Managing Director's Office, Health and Human Services and am participating in multiple consulting projects through the University of Pennsylvania.
