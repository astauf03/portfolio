This project was developed as the final project for *MUSA: 5500: Geospatial Analytics* and focuses on building a **Neighborhood Accessibility Character Map** for Philadelphia, highlighting the Passyunk Square neighborhood. Working in a two-person team, we explored how accessibility varies at the neighborhood scale by integrating multiple spatial dimensions into a single analytical framework.

The analysis combines four core components of accessibility:
- Mobility: walkability, bikeability, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and transit access
- Land Use/Amenities: proximity to essential services such as healthcare and daily goods
- Environmental Quality: vegetation health, park access, and urban tree canopy
- Social/Demographic Conditions: socioeconomic and demographic indicators that shape lived accessibility

These components were normalized and combined into a composite Accessibility Score, which was used to rank neighborhoods and compare relative accessibility patterns across the city.

While the project demonstrates multi-source spatial integration and index construction, the census-based demographic component is subject to limitations stemming from data harmonization and communication challenges during implementation. These constraints are documented and reflected on in the final site.
