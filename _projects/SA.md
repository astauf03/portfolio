**Status:** *In progress (Spring 2026)*

Our team is currently in the early EDA stages of census wrangling and visualizations.

---

**Overview**
This practicum is a client-based applied spatial analytics project conducted as part of the MUSA program. The goal of this project is to prototype a method that quantifies pharmacy access in South Africa, and create an analytical report and a web-based viewer that allows a member of the general public (the user) to understand measures of access and how it varies across space and between sub-populations.

The client, Distributed AI Reserach Institute [DAIR](https://www.dair-institute.org/), is especially interested in the spatial effects of apartheid, and how sub-populations are impacted by the 2024 National Health Insurance (NHI) Act, in the context of pharmacy accessibility and private or public status. Our two study areas are Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.
