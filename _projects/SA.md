title: '[Upcoming Collaboration] MUSA Practicum: Understanding the Geography of Healthcare Access in South Africa (Spring 2026)'
---

**Status:** *In progress (Spring 2026)*

---

**Overview**
This practicum is a client-based applied spatial analytics project conducted as part of the MUSA program. The goal of this project is to prototype a method that quantifies pharmacy access in South Africa, and create an analytical report and a web-based viewer that allows a member of the general public (the user) to understand measures of access and how it varies across space and between sub-populations.

---

**Planned Methods**
- Data wrangling of pharmacies and census data using Google geocoder API, Google Places API, Snowflake API, and Stats SA 2022 Census data.

---

**Planned Key Deliverables**
- Desktop-based application deployed in JavaScript to guide the user through a yet-to-be-determined usecase for this project.
- R Markdown report documenting methods, model functions, and dictating replicability steps.

**Planned Tools:** R, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Google Places API, Snowflake API, Google geocoder API
