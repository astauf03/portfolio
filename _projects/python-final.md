**Takeaway:** A composite accessibility index reveals clear neighborhood-level differences in mobility, amenities, environmental quality, and social context across Philadelphia despite this project's limitations with demographic data integration.

---

**Overview**
This project was developed as the final project for *MUSA 5500: Geospatial Analytics* and evaluates how accessibility varies at the neighborhood scale in Philadelphia, with a focus on Passyunk Square. Working in a two-person team, we integrated multiple spatial datasets into a single, interpretable accessibility framework.


**Key Outputs**
- **Composite interactive website** [Passyunk Square Neighborhood Accessibility Character Map](https://astauf03.github.io/musa5500-python-final/)
- **Code repository** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/astauf03/musa5500-python-final)

**Methods**
Accessibility was modeled using four normalized components:
- **Mobility:** walkability, bikeability, pedestrian infrastructure, and transit access  
- **Land Use & Amenities:** proximity to essential services  
- **Environmental Quality:** vegetation health, parks, and tree canopy  
- **Social & Demographic Context:** socioeconomic indicators shaping lived accessibility  

---

**Key Findings**
- Accessibility varies substantially across neighborhoods depending on component weighting.
- Passyunk Square performs strongly on mobility and amenities relative to citywide patterns.
- Composite scoring highlights tradeoffs between environmental and social accessibility dimensions.

## Limitations: While the project demonstrates multi-source spatial integration and index construction, the census-based demographic component is subject to limitations stemming from data harmonization and communication challenges during implementation. These constraints are documented and reflected on in the final site.
