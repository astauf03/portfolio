## Temple University Ambler Campus: Supervised Change Detection Pre and Post Tornado

**Overview:** 
Delivered as a final project for *MUSA 6320: Modeling Geographic Space* in Fall 2025, this analysis employed supervised classification techniques to detect land cover changes on Temple University’s Ambler Campus before and after a tornado event in September 2021. Using high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 and 2022, the project attempted to identify areas of significant alteration in vegetation, built structures, and impervious surfaces.
