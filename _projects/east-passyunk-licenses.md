### Key outputs
- 1-page memo (PDF): [memo2.pdf](/assets/img/projects/east-passyunk-licenses/memo2.pdf)
- ArcGIS Online dashboard: [View dashboard](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/cbd683681e3941788922678e58f0f793)
- Code/reproducibility notes: [View R HTML report](https://astauf03.github.io/spatial-analysis-portfolio/liquor_license_dashboard/licensingstuff.html)

##### Notes on data
The OpenDataPhilly business license GeoJSON is too large to store in this repo. To reproduce locally, download it from OpenDataPhilly and place it in the expected `data/` path used in the Rmd.
